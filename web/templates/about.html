<h1 class="title">About</h1>

<p>What is this site? Most aircraft have transponders which are continuously transmitting radio signals with information about the flight. I'm receiving those signals with a USB software defined radio (SDR), saving all of the radio messages into a database, and processing the messages to present the data you see on this site. All of the flight data you see on this flight is what I have been able to receive over-the-air from my house near the Hillsboro Airport (KHIO).</p>

<h2>Data sources</h2>

<p>The flight data is all logged by the radio receiver at my house.</p>

<p>United States aircraft registration info is from the <a href="https://www.faa.gov/licenses_certificates/aircraft_certification/aircraft_registry/releasable_aircraft_download/">FAA civil aircraft registration database</a>. Canadian aircraft registration details from from the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/935cf4d3-7e8d-4e9b-8dfd-c02643d4f782">Transport Canada Civil Aircraft Register Database</a>.</p>

<p>Basic type and registration information for other aircraft is from <a href="https://junzis.com/adb/data">J. Sun's World Aircraft Database</a> and FlightAware's <a href="https://github.com/flightaware/dump1090/tree/master/tools">aircraft data file</a> that is included with dump1090.</p>

<p>Airline data courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/jpatokal/openflights/">openflights.org</a></p>

<p>Aircraft icons in the flight list are shamelessly pilfered from dump1090, who credits FlightAware as the original source.</p>

<h2>Source code</h2>

<p>All of the code to log and decode the data, and run this site, is written in Go and available under an open source license on <a href="https://github.com/racingmars/flighttrack">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>Database size</h2>

<p>I have been logging received messages continuously since March 9, 2019.</p>
